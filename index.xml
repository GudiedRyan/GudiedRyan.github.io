      <description>My name is Ryan Guide. I lived in Pittsburgh until I turned 4, then I moved to State College where I currently live. In 2016 I attended Allegheny College, where I graduated with a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in mathematics in 2020. As the pandemic shut down the world, I began looking into new paths to follow. In the summer of 2021, I met with Dr. Patrick McDaniel, and joined the SIIS Lab.</description>
